	//     network operator, etc). When set to true, it is installed into `/product` (or
	//     `/system/product` if product partition does not exist).
    //   system_ext_specific: true,
    //     For modules which extends system. When set to true, it is installed into `/system_ext`
	//     (or `/system/system_ext` if system_ext partition does not exist).
    //   device_specific: true,
    //     For device specific modules, not only for SoC, but also for off-chip peripherals. When 
    //     set to true, it is installed into `/odm` (or `/vendor/odm` if odm partition does not 
    //     exist, or /system/vendor/odm if both odm and vendor partitions do not exist). This 
    //     implies `soc_specific:true`.
